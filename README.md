<u>Exam 2:</u>




<strong>This exam contains two problems, each asking </strong><strong><em><u>four</u></em></strong><strong> questions</strong><strong>. Please answer each question <u>in detail with clear explanation</u>. &#x1f642;</strong>




<strong><u>Problem 1.</u></strong> Find the index of the smallest number in a sorted array where the first k numbers were shifted to the end.




An example of a sorted array where the first k numbers were shifted to the end:




<strong> </strong>

<em><u>Example 1</u></em>:  <em><u>Input</u></em>: a = [2, 5, 8, 10, 12, 0, 1] ➔ <em><u>Output</u></em>:  5

<em><u>Example 2</u></em>: <em><u>Input</u></em>: a = [1, 6, 9, 10] ➔ <em><u>Output</u></em>:  0

<em><u>Example 3</u></em>: <em><u>Input</u></em>: a = [20, 30, 40, 1, 5, 10] ➔ <em><u>Output</u></em>:  3

<strong> </strong>

<strong> </strong>

<ol>

 <li>How would you find the index of the smallest number? (<strong>Note</strong>: If you have multiple answers in mind, break them apart and explain each one separately.) Explain each solution/algorithm in a few lines.</li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li>Write the pseudocode for the best algorithm you came up with.</li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li>Implement your answer using any programming language you want to.</li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li>What is the time complexity of your answer? <strong>Explain in detail and show all the work</strong>. (<strong>Note</strong>: If possible, break your code/pseudocode to different parts, calculate the runtime for each step and then try to calculate the total running time based on that.)</li>

</ol>

<strong> </strong>

<strong><u>Problem 2.</u></strong> You are given <em>k</em> sorted arrays in descending order of size <em>n</em>. Develop an algorithm to merge them into a single sorted array of size <em>kn</em>.

(<strong>Hint 1</strong>:

<ol>

 <li>Can you find the largest number in each array? (This step will give you <strong><em>k</em></strong> numbers)</li>

 <li>How would you find the max value among these <strong><em>k</em></strong> numbers? What is the best algorithm you can come up with?</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>Do you know from which array the max value came from? iv. Now, how would you find the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest element?</li>

</ul>

<strong>Hint 2</strong>:  “The root has the largest value in a <u>max heap</u>”. Can you guess where knowing this statement might help you?

<em> </em>

<em><u>Example</u></em>:

a1 = [8, 4, 2, 0],  a2 = [20, 15, 5, 3],  a3 = [10, 7, 6, 1],

<em><u>Output</u></em>:  Merged array: [ 20 15 10 8 7 6 5 3 2 1 0]
